# Unity App - Don't Be a Scardy Cat

## Project Pitch:
The aim of this web application is to provide the user with a cat-themed game that is fun to play! This is a 2d platform, endless runner game. When the game begins, a cat character will begin running across the screen (from left to right). The player’s goal is to keep the game going for as long as possible while collecting fishes for extra points. The game ends when the cat hits an item that the cat is scared of (i.e. vaccum, blender, noise makers, water, spoiled food).

## User Stories:
As a user, I should be able to:
- See the game rendered in the web browser
- Click ‘start’ to begin a game
- Press space bar to jump
- See points accumulating in the top corner of the screen
- Have points accumulate over time
- Have the character collide with (collect) fishes to gain extra points
- Have the character collide with 'bad things' (i.e. things cat is scared of) to end the game
- See 'Game Over' with total points earned when game has ended
- See option to enter score with user's name into the high score list
- Have user name & high score saved to rails backend
- View high score list via rails backend


## Bonus Deliverables:
As a user, it would be nice to be able to:
- Invite friends to play
- Add friends to friend list
- See list of high scores amongst friends only
